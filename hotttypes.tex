\section{\HoTT{} Types}
\label{subs:hott}

\HoTT{} primitives are ....\sidenote{A proper exposition would
  list 1) the name of the primitive, e.g. ``Dependent Product-type'';
  2) the ``constructor'' symbol, e.g. \(\Pi\); 3) the analogous
  concept from set theory; 4) the ``rules'' for defining a type
  (formation, construction, elimination, computation, uniqueness).}

\begin{ednote}
  The concept of primitives probably isn't going to work for type
  theories proper.  Type theories seem to be inherently pluralistic,
  so there is no way to pick out some things as intrinsically
  primitive in all type theories.  Each theory might \emph{define} a
  set of primitives, but that would define conventions of the theory,
  not the notion of primitive that we're after here.  So if we want to
  talk about primitives it will have to be as above, involving
  principles antecedent to any type-theoretic talk. (?)

\subsection{Simple Types}
\label{subs:simpletypes}

\begin{ednote}
  E.g. \N
\end{ednote}

``Proposition type'' Conceptually, at least, this seems primitive.
Especially if the concept of ``proposition'' counts as a pre-theoretic
principle.  Which implies that proof is also a pre-theoretic
principle.  Proposition types are fundamentally different than the
other kinds of type, since they have
truth-conditions.\sidenote{Actually this isn't quite right.
  Propositions have truth-conditions in classic logic, but not not in
  type theory.  In type theory they have proofs; a propositional type
  is not true or false, but proven or disproven.  But the larger point
  stands: the \textit{concept} of proposition is different than the
  concept of, say, natural number.} Etc.  It follows that proofs are
fundamentally different from other kinds of witness.

\begin{ednote}
  But Curry-Howard means there is no distinction between types and
  propositions, so it makes no sense to try to demarcate a
  ``proposition type''.  E.g. the type \N can be viewed as the type of
  ``there exists a natural number''.  This feature demarcates type
  theory; in classic logic and math, and esp. traditional logic, there
  is a fundamental difference between propositions and the terms from
  which they are constructed.  Not so in \tth{}.
\end{ednote}

\subsection{Compound Types}
\label{subs:compountypes}

\begin{description}
\item [Function] ``Unlike in set theory, functions are not defined as
  functional relations; rather they are a primitive concept in type
  theory.''\sidenote{Or: set theory
    \textit{defines} a function as a set of ordered pairs whose domain
    has no duplicates; in other words, it treats a function and its
    ``graph'' as the same thing.  Question: what happens to the graph
    of a function in type theory?} \citep[p. 21]{hottbook}

\item [Product] Product types correspond to cartesian products in set
  theory.  The constructor symbol is the same as in set theory:
  \(\cross\).\sidenote{Why isn't this called the ``\(\Huge\cross\)-type''?}
  ``[U]nlike in set theory, where we define ordered pairs to be
  particular sets and then collect them all together into the
  cartesian product, in type theory, ordered pairs are a primitive
  concept, as are functions.''\citep[p. 26]{hottbook}

\item [Coproduct type] Coproduct types correspond to disjoint unions
  in set theory.  ``In type theory, as was the case with functions and
  products, the coproduct must be a fundamental construction, since
  there is no previously defined notion of ``union of
  types''.\citep[p. 33]{hottbook}

\end{description}

\begin{ednote}
  [Updated] [Update: M. Shulman pulled the scales from my eyes: ``From
    the point of view taken in the book, the difference is only one of
    perspective, and any type can represent a proposition by simply
    shifting our perspective on it. For instance, the type Nat
    represents the proposition "there exists a natural number".'']
  What I've called ``proposition type'' is not \textit{formally}
  distinct; the distinction I'm after is conceptual.  But this
  suggests that we need to add at least one more item to our list of
  primitives: ``ordinary'' or simple types.  Maybe it would be best to
  start with the natural numbers as an example of a simple type,
  rather than function types.  Then an example of a proposition type,
  before proceeding to function type.  The items listed (following the
  \HoTTB{}) are really constructions, or let's say complex types,
  built out of two other types.  So maybe the distinction we want is
  between simple and complex or compound types.  Then the simple types
  would come out as primitive, and the complex types as derived (just
  like dependent types.)  Compare the idea of constructions in
  category theory.  There categories are primitive and e.g. the
  product category is an example of a category constructed from other
  categories.
\end{ednote}

\begin{ednote}
  For consistency, we might want to use symbols to designate all of
  the primitives, just as we do for \(\Pi\) and \(\Sigma\).  This
  would give us: \(\Huge\fun\)-types, \(\Huge\cross\)-types, and
  \(\Huge +\)-types.
\end{ednote}

\subsection{Dependent Types}
\label{subs:quasiprim}

\noindent ``Fundamental''\sidenote[][-28pt]{\begin{ednote}
  Obviously we need a better bit of
  terminology.  ``Quasi-primitives''?  ``Neo-primitives''?  These
  types are not primitive, strictly speaking, but on the other hand
  they are basic.  I think there is another fundamental principle at
  work here.  In set theory, for example, the concept of function is
  not only not primitive, it isn't necessary.  You could discard it
  and still have set theory.  But my intuition tells me that e.g. the
  concept \(\Pi\)-type is in a sense necessary or essential in type
  theory, even if it is not primitive.  Once you have the primitives,
  you necessarily have these non-primitive basic types.  Dunno if
  that's correct, but it would sure be nice if it were.
  \end{ednote}}%
(but non-primitive) concepts and types.  These types seem to be on a par
with the primitive types as far as importance goes, but they
presuppose the primitives, so cannot themselves be considered
primitive.

\begin{ednote}
  We can make a distinction between the concept of dependent type, and
  the two specific dependent types introduced here.  Neither is
  primitive; you can have a type theory without the concept of
  dependent types.  Most programming languages fit this description,
  whether they have an explicit type discipline or not.
\end{ednote}

\begin{ednote}
  Regarding the notion ``quasi-primitive'': not a very satisfactory
  term, but I can't come up with a better one at the moment.  What I'd
  like to show is that the concept of dependent type (maybe also type
  universe) follows ``naturally'' or necessarily or essentially from
  the more primitive concepts.  Maybe the right concept here is
  ``induction'': the primitive concepts (types) ``induce'' the concept
  of dependent type.  That would be nice esp. if induction is a
  primary principle.
\end{ednote}

\begin{theorem}

\end{theorem}

  test definition.
\end{definition}

\begin{description}

\item [Universe]  Is this a primitive?  Probably not, since it builds on the type concept.

\item [\(\Pi\)-type] Informally, ``dependent function''
  types.\sidenote{As a practical matter, I think it would be useful to
    have an informal term for these types that falls between
    ``dependent function type'' and \(\Pi\)-type.  Something like
    ``p-function type''.  \(\Pi\)-type is admirably concise, but I
    think it should mention ``function'', since it names a kind of
    function.}  The concept of \(\Pi\)-type is a generalization of the
  concept of function type, so it isn't primitive.

\item [\(\Sigma\)-type] Informally, ``dependent pair''
  type.\sidenote{Shouldn't this be called ``dependent
    \textit{product}'' type?  The type is product, not pair; pairs are
    ``elements'' of the type.  Informally, maybe ``sig-prod type?}
  The concept of \(\Sigma\)-types is a generalization of the concept
  of product type.

\end{description}

\subsection{Standard Type Library}
\label{subs:hottstdlib}

\begin{ednote}
  By analogy to the usual ``standard library'' of programming
  languages.  The idea is to list commonly used types that are neither
  primitive nor quasi-primitive; ``application'' types, in a sense.
\end{ednote}


\begin{description}
\item [Boolean] \citep[p. 34]{hottbook}
\item [$\nat$] \citep[p. 36]{hottbook} But there's a problem here;
  actually several.  First of all, the section on the naturals in
  chapter one does not actually show how to construct them; its really
  a section about induction, not the natural numbers.  Second, what it
  does say about the naturals is that they start from zero.  That
  obviously won't do; zero is not a natural number, and there is no
  intuitive notion of zero as a number.  You can't even think of it as
  a number until you've severed the link between the concept of number
  and the concepts of quantity and/or magnitude.  So the natural
  numbers really must start with 1, not 0.
\item [Proposition]  Moved to Primitives section.
\item [Identity]
