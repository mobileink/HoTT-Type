\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Currently this doc contains the intro and chapter 1 from the
  \href{http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/}{HoTT Book}, followed by
  some notes.  Eventually the intro and chapter 1 will contain
  annotations, comments, additional examples, etc., but I have not
  started that yet, so if you are already familiar with the text you
  need not read them -- I haven't (so far as I recall) changed anything.

  The idea is to winnow out some of the strictly mathematical stuff
  leaving the core ``philosophical'' stuff, and annotate the text with
  some comments and quotes from Martin-L\"{o}f, Brandom, etc.  Or
  maybe leave the math stuff in, but annotate it with more detailed
  explanation and examples in programming languages.  In any case the
  purpose is to more fully articulate the link between HoTT's ideas of
  type and judgment (etc.) to the philosophical debates about
  language, assertion, proposition from which they emerged.  Why?
  Because I find those bits of the HoTT a little murky, and
  philosophers like Brandom have a lot to say about the issues.  Also,
  to show more clearly how type theory differs from set theory and
  classic logic.  Another goal is to provide more practical guidance
  to programmers interested in exploring dependent types.

\section{The Language of \HoTT}
\label{sect:hottlang}

One way to think about mathematics and logic is in terms of objects,
structures, relations, and the like.  etc.

But one can also think of it in terms of vocabularies (or idioms,
etc.).  Then mastering a discipline is not just a matter grasping some
content, but also of acquiring practical mastery over a vocabulary.

The vocabulary of set theory has dominated mathematical discourse for
most of the last 100 years or so.  Starting in the late 1940s, a
competing vocabulary based on category theory began to emerge.  Today
it is not uncommon to see both vocabularies deployed in the same
discourse (lecture, paper).

{\todo Type theory as a vocabulary - mostly confined to logic, then
  computer science.  Etc.  \HoTT{} as the latest distinctive vocab. -
  covering both math and compsci, also regions of logic.
  Significantly different that both set theory and classic logic.}

\section{Truth}
\label{sect:truth}

Why Truth is Not Important in Type Theory (with apologies to
R. Brandom\cite{brandom_why_2009})

\begin{ednote}
  Propositions are either true or false in classic math and logic; in
  type theory they are either proven or disproven.  In this respect
  type theory is just like contemporary pragmatism, which (generally
  speaking) treats truth as otiose; what matters is not truth but
  function or expressiveness.

  This suggests a test for learners: until you've grasped why truth is
  not imporant in type theory you haven't really grasped type theory.
\end{ednote}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Assertion and Judgment}
\label{sect:assertionjudgment}

The account of judgment offered in the HoTT Book doesn't really work.
Ditto for Martin-L\"{o}f's account.  For example, it makes sense to
say ``P is a proposition'', but it doesn't make sense to say ``P is a
judgment''.  That's because judgment is a act, something one does.

On the other hand, ``judgment'', like ``proposition'', can be treated
as a verbal noun or as a ``plain'' noun.  Saying ``P is a
proposition'' is usually taken to mean that P refers to what has been
proposed.  There is no obvious reason not to treat ``P is a judgment''
in a similar manner: P refers to what has been judged.

However, there is a difference.  Judging a proposition (what was
proposed) amounts to \textit{evaluating} what was proposed, as good or
bad, true or false, or whatever.  By contrast, proposing a proposition
amounts to merely exhibiting it for consideration.  This arguably
involves an implicit evaluation - to propose a proposition is to
implicitly claim that it is good, or true, etc.  But proposing does
not involve offering an evaluation that is distinct from what is
proposed, whereas judgment does.  The two are distinct kinds of speech
act, and refering to the content of a speech act is not the same as
referring to the speech act itself.

Furthermore, it is not correct to treat the nominal sense of
``judgment'' as being the content, what has been judged.  The nominal
sense of ``judgment'' refers to the act of judgment itself, and not
the proposition judged.

Actually, by the same reasoning it is not correct to say that the
nominal sense of ``proposition'' is what-is-proposed; rather, it is
the act proposing, nominalized.  This makes perfect sense when you
consider that ``proposing'' can also be nominalized; ``the proposing''
is another way of saying ``the proposition''.

The same goes for all -tion words: suggestion, opposition, etc.  In
each case, the word can refer to the doing, or to what is done, and
what is done is always the act of doing itself -- not the subject or
object of the doing.

This suggests we should make a distinction between, for example, the
content of a proposition and ``proposition''.  But this term seems to
be a special case; it has the usual plain noun sense of
what-was-proposed, the usual verbal sense of ``proposing'', but also
the nominalized verbal sense of ``act of proposing''.

(But then the same considerations apply to ``judgment''.  The
difference must go back to semantics.)

\begin{remark}
  The Arabic grammatical tradition captures this distinction
  beautifully, mainly because the structure of the language makes it
  simple to do so.
\end{remark}

Or put it this way: when we judge a proposition like ``2+2=4'' to be
true, the what-was-judged is not ``2+2=4'' but the truth of ``2+2=4''.

\begin{remark}
  But how is this different from ordinary predication, like ``The
  triangle is red'' as a proposition?  Should we say that what is
  proposed is not that the triangle is red, but the redness of the
  triangle?  No, since we're treating it as a propostion, and the
  whole thing is proposed (exhibited).  If we judge it to be true,
  then again the judgment 
\end{remark}

So saying ``P is a judgment'' is incoherent if P is taken to refer to
nothing more than what is proposed.  If P refers to a claim of the
form ``X is true'' (or good, etc.), then ``P is a judgment'' seems to
make more sense; but it doesn't, really.  P still refers to an
unasserted content; to make sense, we would have to say something like
``P is a judgment when asserted''.  More explicitly, ``'X is true' is
a judgment'' (or better, ``'X is true' expresses a judgment'') only
\textit{exhibits} ``X is true'', which is a proposition, not a
judgment.  As a proposition it expresses a judgment; but when embedded
(equivalently, quoted) it does not express anything.

\begin{remark}
  Compare: ``Snow is white'' iff snow is white.  The quoted bit is a
  name of the sentence; it counts as a \textit{mention} of the
  sentence, which has no force.  The unquoted version of same is the
  sentence itself; it counts as a \textit{use} of the sentence, which
  has assertional force.  Obviously, the occurances of ``P'' in ``P is
  a proposition'' and ``P is a judgment are names of a proposition and
  thus mentions.  So they have no force.
\end{remark}

The key point is Frege's point: the content of a proposition is
distinct from the force of the utterance.  That means that P in ``P is
a proposition'' is unasserted, just as it is when embedded, as in ``If
P then Q''.  The truth of ``P is a proposition'' is independent of the
truth of P.

So even if we take the act of declaring ``P'' to be an act of
judgment, it does not follow that a reference to P is a reference to
the act of judging that P.  Hence there is no way to make ``P is a
judgment'' work.  If we take P to refer to what was judged, that again
is a proposition (or propositional content), so ``P is a judgment'' is
incoherent.

\begin{remark}
  We can assert that P, and we can assert P.  We can judge that P, but
  we cannot judge P.  I don't think this is a mere grammatical
  distintion; I think it reflects a genuine semantic difference.
\end{remark}

\section{Expressivity}
\label{sect:expressivity}

Instead of ``P is a proposition'' etc. we should say ``P expresses a proposition''.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Classics}
\label{sect:classics}

hypothesis: classical math with LEM and AC is inherently
non-deterministic.  Constructive math(s) and logic(s) that discard LEM
and AC are deterministic.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Modality}
\label{sect:modality}

Classic proofs (that use LEM) are modal.  Consider the way a classic
LEM-dependent proof works.  You start by stating the hypothesis: P is
true.  You assume that P is not true; then you derive a contradiction.
The conclusion is not merely that P is true, however; it is that P
\textit{must} be true.

Constructive proofs, by contrast, are not modal.  They do not say what
must be the case, they say what \textit{is} the case.  Or rather, they
\textit{show} what is the case.  (I leave aside the question of
whether what is, is necessary.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Habeus Corpus Logics}
\label{sect:habeus}

The principle of ``Habeus Corpus'', from the Latin ``(You shall) have
the body'', was once enshrined as a fundamental principle of
Anglo-American law.  It was used to force the State to present a
detainee in person before the court, back in the days when we
occasionally had the temerity to question the wisdom of the State when
it tried to disappear people.

Type theory, and constructive logics generally, operate under a writ
of habeus corpus that is permanently in effect.  Except that this writ
requires the production not of a detainee, but of a witness.  If you
claim to have a proof, you must produce a witness who is competent to
testify to that fact.  So its actually more like a law of evidence,
but I'm too lazy to come up with a clever legalism to express that
idea.

\section{From Truth to Testimony}
\label{sect:truth}

We have propositions as types, and we have non-propositional types
like $\nat$.  There is an obvious conflict of intuitions here.
Propositions, like \(1>0\), have truth conditions; names like \(\nat\)
do not.  How can they be the same kind of thing?

I think the way out of this embarrassment is recognition that the
classic concept of truth is not relevant to type theory; or, in a more
positive vein, that only a deflationary or minimalist notion of truth
should be used in type theory.  In type theory one does not say that a
proposition \textit{is} true or false; instead one says that a
(propositional) type is proven or disproven, or that either it or its
negation has a witness\sidenote{Or, a ``maker'' or ``constructor''.}.  Instead of a concept of truth we have a
concept of testimony.  Of course, ordinarily witnesses testify as to
the truth of some proposition; but the witnesses of type theory do
more than that---or rather they do something else, namely they produce
or ``make'' the proposition.

%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Proof, Witness, Constructor}
\label{subs:pwc}

Type theory seems to have settled on an idiom; one says, for example,
that types have or do not have proofs or witnesses.  But there are
problems with both of these terms.  The former covers too much ground
since it includes non-constructive proofs.  The latter invokes a
misleading metaphor, since a witness testifies to the truth, whereas a
type-theoretic witness to a type constructs (makes, produces, etc.)
something.  In the case of propositional types, constructors ``make''
the proposition (in the sense that they are inferences that terminate
in the proposition); in the case of non-propositional types,
constructors make ``elements'' of the type, which serve as proxies(?) for
the type.

\begin{remark}
  Problem: here again propositional and non-propositional types behave
  differently.  Every proof of a proposition has the proposition as
  its conclusion; they are all ``the same'' because they all have that
  element in the same structural position.  But the proof of
  e.g. \(\nat\) is different.  For example, \(2\) is a witness for
  \(\nat\).  Or rather, anything that constructs \(2\) is such a
  witness.  What all such constructions have in common is \(2\), not
  \(\nat\).  So they are all clearly proofs of \(2\), but we want them
  to be proofs of \(\nat\).  How do we get there?
\end{remark}
