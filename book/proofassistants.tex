The \textit{specification} language of Coq is Gallina.

The ``vernacular'' is Coq's command language - it allows you to talk
to the Coq system itself.

\enquote{The relation between a program and its type is the same as
  the relation between a proof and that statement it proves.  Thus
  verifying a proof is done by a type verification algorithm.} p. 4

\enquote{An important characteristic of the Caculus of Constructions is that
every type is also a term and also has a type.  The type of a
proposition is called \texttt{Prop}.  For instance, they proposition
\(3\leq 7\) is at the same time the type of all proofs that 3 is
smaller than 7 and a term of type \texttt{Prop}.} p. 4

\enquote{In the same spirit, a \textit{predicate} makes it possible to
  build a parametric proposition...[E]xamples of predicates are the
  predicate `to be a sorted list' with type \texttt{(list Z)->Prop}
  and the binary relation \(\leq\), with type \texttt{Z->Z->Prop}.} p. 4
